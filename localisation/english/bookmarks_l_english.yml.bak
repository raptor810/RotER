 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Republics of the East"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Middle East is not a thriving place or a global powerhouse. While America is now the sole hegemon of the world, East Asia possesses rich economies, and Europe has the highest living standards on Earth, the Middle East still tears itself apart resources and petty land claims. Each of these countries are working toward very different goals, and we will see who succeeds. Will the established order maintain control, or will multipolarity rule tomorrow?"
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Near East has endured much bloodshed and will endure much more. Will the countries comprising this region lean towards authoritarian monarchy, liberal democracy, or maybe a more fundamentalist ideology? It is up to those who lead these tenuous governments to pursue a different future."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Unused"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "This is not a playable scenario and will not be made to work."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Placeholder"
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Egypt, along with the rest of the Arab World, is reeling from the consequences of the Arab Spring. While there was a real chance of democracy being instituted, reality sets in as el-Sisi nears the beginning of his third term as president. Islamists are engaging in a prolonged insurgency in the Sinai, resulting in thousands dead and many more injured. Egypt may know change again, but that is yet to be seen."
 SAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Engaged in proxy conflict with Iran since the 1979 revolution, Saudi Arabia is currently attempting to fight Iranian influence in places like Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. Sadly, our intervention has been growing increasingly unpopular along with stalemates and defeat. Maybe, just maybe, we can restore our dominance over the Middle East, if we turn these proxy wars around."
 IRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iran has been increasing in power ever since the Islamic Revolution, funding militias and alternate governments across the Middle East and thus gaining competent allies to use against enemies of Iran. Iran also has a nuclear program, and if they can keep it secret for long enough they may become the predominant nuclear power in the region. One day, Iran may have enough proxies to start a war to destroy the decadent Saudis and Zionists."
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iraq has suffered more than most in the world and in this region of it. From attacking Iran, then Kuwait, and thus bearing the consequences of defeat to the USA. Following 9/11, Iraq's government would be blamed for posessing dangerous weaponry and would be invaded a second time by the USA, this time decisively. The Islamic State brutalized Iraq until their eventual weakening, and now Iraq is dominated by corruption and militias."
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Israel is quite different compared to their neighbors. A parliamentary republic in a sea of absolute monarchies, and the only Jewish state, Israel has done quite well. Defeating their neighbors in multiple wars, Israel secured peace with most and trade with many more. Since then however, Israel has suffered setbacks. Defeat in Lebanon, failure to make peace with Palestinians, and a withdrawal from Gaza resulting in Hamas takeover, Israel has to solve these problems one way or another."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A member of NATO and the controller of a very powerful military, Turkey is very influential across the Middle East. Turkey has supressed Kurds in the southeast, intervened in Syria, and made allies across the region. An armed forces coup was attempted in 2016, but Erdoğan still rules. With a large economy and decent regional power, Turkey may decide the future of their neighbors."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Enduring a brutal civil war since 2011 with hundreds of thousands dead, Syria is in a tough situation. While the official government does control most of the land and enjoys backing from the Russians and Iranians, war has yet to conclude. While the lines are starting to look more than temporary, possibly the war may come to a decisive end."
 CYG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Cyprus is a country torn in two. Turkey invaded almost 50 years ago setting up a client government to prevent Greek influence and potential unification..."
 CYT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Northern Cyprus became independent following Turkish military intervening against a Greek coup on the island. Currently, Northern Cyprus is unrecognized by everyone but Turkey and ultimately controlled by them."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A NATO member in Europe, Greece has been declining economically for years. Potentially things can turn around, but it would require substanial change."
 GEO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dealing with Russian-backed seperatists since the fall of the Soviet Union and a direct invasion by Russia in 2008, Georgia has endured tough times. Losing the territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and the resulting ethnic cleansing made Georgia desperately seek NATO membership, which sadly can not be granted until the territory dispute is resolved."
 AZR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An ally of Turkey and fierce enemy of Armenia, Azerbaijan was defeated by the latter in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. Preparing ever since and growing the Azerbaijani economy, there may be a chance to claw victory from the enemy."
 ARM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Armenia a Christian country in the Caucasus, is reconsidering their policy. Victorious in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenia has been a great friend to Russia. This is however being reconsidered as Russia wanes in power and Armenia's enemy Azerbaijan grows stronger, alliances may need to change."
 LEB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Lebanon in the modern day is barely a country. Hezbollah is popular in the government and controls swathes of land in the South, and there are no actions to be taken. Lebanese history isn't bright either, with a civil war, invasion by Israel, and occupation by Syria. Drastic changes in course would need to be taken to salvage a prosperous future from this situation."
 JOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Jordan has had little influence in the Middle East ever since the conclusion of hostilities with Israel, and has since became a Major non-NATO Ally along with Egypt and Israel, assisting in efforts against the Islamic State and in conflict in Yemen."
 PLS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the Oslo accords, limited Palestinian autonomy was permitted in the West Bank and Gaza with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority. Since then, Israeli settlements have expanded greatly and Gaza ended up under control of Hamas following an Israeli disengagement. Abbas has ruled for nearly 15 years and is unlikely to allow elections to proceed, although there may be a chance for democracy... or something less hopeful."
 PAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005, and following this Hamas won elections. Following conflict between Hamas and Fatah, the former ultimately took power. Since then, multiple rocket attacks and wars with Israel have occured, causing huuman suffering for both sides. However, with support from Iran and Hezbollah, Hamas may be able to secure victory over the Zionists."
 YEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Torn by civil war and previous conflicts for decades, Yemen will only see change with peace and reconciliation, or decisive victory from one side or another."
 OMA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Relatively quiet on the world stage as a neutral country, Oman has been balancing relationships with the USA and Iran. Staying on this path could lead Oman to an economically prosperous future."
 UAE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An absurdly rich country on the Persian Gulf, the United Arab Emirates has made lots of money from oil and constructed Dubai."
